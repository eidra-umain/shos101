## **2. Understanding Key Concepts**

### **Free Software vs. Open-Source Software**

Before diving into self-hosting, it's important to understand the difference between **free software** and **open-source software**:

#### **Free Software** 🆓
- Refers to software that gives users the freedom to **use, modify, and share** it without restrictions.
- Focuses on **user rights**, but the **source code may or may not be available**.
- Example: Some freeware applications allow usage but do not provide access to the source code.

#### **Open-Source Software** 🔓
- The **source code is publicly available** for anyone to **view, modify, and distribute**.
- Encourages **transparency and collaboration** in software development.
- Open-source software **can be free**, but not all **open-source licenses** allow unrestricted use.
- Example: Metabase, WordPress, and Supabase are open-source tools that can be self-hosted.

📌 **Key takeaway:**
All **open-source software** provides access to the source code, but not all **free software** does. Open-source software can be **self-hosted** for full control over your data and configurations.
