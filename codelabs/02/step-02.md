## **Step 02: Understanding Git and Version Control**



### **Skills Covered**

•  What is a Version Control System?

•  Three-stage workflow in Git

•  Collaborating with others using Git

•  Git Architecture (How Git Works)

•  Basic Git Commands



### **Topics Covered**



✅ What is Git?

✅ Git vs. GitHub (and alternatives like Bitbucket & GitLab)

✅ Installing Git

✅ Basic Git commands (commit, push, pull, branch, merge)

✅ How Git helps in teamwork



### **Why Learn Git?**



Git is one of the most **widely used** tools in software development. It helps track changes in code, work with multiple people on the same project, and avoid “oops, I lost my work” moments.



Even if you’re just starting, **learning Git is a must-have skill** for managing projects efficiently.



### **With Git, you can:**



✅ Save different versions of your work (like an “undo” button for coding)

✅ Work with teams across the world

✅ Keep your projects organized and safe

✅ Easily fix mistakes or go back to previous versions



## **Git vs. GitHub (and other alternatives)**



**Git** is the tool that manages your code history. **GitHub**, **GitLab**, and **Bitbucket** are **online services** that store your Git projects and make it easier to collaborate with others.

•  **GitHub** – The most popular platform for sharing Git projects.

•  **GitLab** – A self-hosted alternative with built-in DevOps tools.

•  **Bitbucket** – Used by teams working with **Atlassian tools** (like Jira).


In this codelab, we’ll **use GitHub**, but the concepts apply to any Git-based service.


**Basic Git Commands You’ll Learn**


| **Command**  | **What it Does** |
|--|--|
| git init| Start a new Git project |
| git clone [URL] | Copy an existing project |
| git add [file] |  Track changes in a file  |
| git commit -m "message" |Save changes  |
| git push | Upload changes to GitHub |
| git pull |  Get the latest changes from GitHub |
| git branch| Manage different versions of your project|
| git merge | Combine different branches|



**Who Should Learn Git?**



Anyone working on **projects that change over time** can benefit from Git:

💡 **Developers** – Track and manage code

💡 **Designers** – Save different versions of designs

💡 **Writers** – Keep versions of documents



Even if you’re working **alone**, Git is a **lifesaver** for managing your work!
