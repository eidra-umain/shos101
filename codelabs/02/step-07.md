```sh
ngrok http 8000 --oauth-allow-email your-email@gmail.com
```


### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Starting a Local Web Service**



Before using Ngrok, make sure you have a **local web service running**.



**Quick Setup Using Python**

1.  Open **Terminal** or **Command Prompt**.

2.  Create a new directory and navigate to it:


```sh
mkdir ~/ngrok-demo && cd ~/ngrok-demo
```


3.  Create an **index.html** file with the following content:


```html
<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
```

4.  Start a basic **local web server** using Python:


```sh
python3 -m http.server 8000
```


5.  Open **http://localhost:8000** in your browser to see your page.



Now, you can **expose this local service using Ngrok**:


```sh
ngrok http 8000
```

Your local webpage is now **accessible from anywhere!** üåç



### **7Ô∏è‚É£ Why is Ngrok Useful?**



üìå **Test your app on your phone** ‚Äì Open the Ngrok link on your phone.

üìå **Share with others** ‚Äì Send the link to a friend, and they can see your app.

üìå **Webhook Testing** ‚Äì If a service (like PayPal or GitHub) needs to send data to your app, use Ngrok.



Now you‚Äôre all set to expose your local app to the internet securely! üöÄ
